                    <br /> <br />
                    The system employed a Raspberry Pi, a Wii Balance Board, and an AlphaBot2-Pi robot. We used the Wii Balance Board to control the robot's movements and the Raspberry Pi 
                    to process the data and send commands to the robot. We defined a set of tasks and their respective time constraints to test the kernel's task scheduling capabilities.
